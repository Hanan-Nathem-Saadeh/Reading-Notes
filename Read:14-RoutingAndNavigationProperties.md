# Read: 14 - Routing and Navigation Properties
# ASP.NET MVC Routing
- The ASP.NET Routing module is responsible for mapping incoming browser requests to particular MVC controller actions
- ASP.NET Routing is enabled in your application's Web configuration file (Web.config file)
- There are four sections in the configuration file that are relevant to routing: 
     - the system.web.httpModules section.
     - the system.web.httpHandlers section.
     - the system.webserver.modules section.
     - and the system.webserver.handlers section.
- a route table is created in the application's Global.asax file : which  is a special file that contains event handlers for ASP.NET application lifecycle events.
