# Swagger (OpenAPI)
- is a language-agnostic specification for describing REST APIs. 
-  It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a REST API without direct access to the source code.
-  Its main goals are to:
        - Minimize the amount of work needed to connect decoupled services.
        - Reduce the amount of time needed to accurately document a service.
- "Swagger" refers to the family of open-source and commercial products from SmartBear that work with the OpenAPI Specification. 
- offers a web-based UI that provides information about the service, using the generated OpenAPI specification.
- Both Swashbuckle and NSwag include an embedded version of Swagger UI.
- Each public action method in your controllers can be tested from the UI
