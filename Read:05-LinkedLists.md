## 1- Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency
- Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. it based on 2 factors:(Running Time,Memory Space).
- Big O’s role in algorithm efficiency is to describe the Worst Case of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing it’s job. 
- 4 Key Areas for analysis:
     * Input Size : use the letter n to refer to it.
     * Units of Measurement:
         * Three Measurements of time: milliseconds ,operations ,Basic Operations.
         * Four Sources of Memory Usage during function run-time : code for the algorithm,input ,output ,working space.
     * Orders of Growth :

     * Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case:
        * Worst Case: The efficiency for the worst possible input of size n.
        * Best Case: The efficiency for the best possible input of size n.
        * Average Case: The efficiency for a “typical” or “random” input of size n.
    **Basic asymptotic**
