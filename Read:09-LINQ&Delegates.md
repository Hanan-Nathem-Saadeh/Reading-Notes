# LINQ & Delegates
---
### LINQ : (Language-Integrated Query)
- a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language.
- The LINQ family of technologies provides a consistent query experience for objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases (LINQ to SQL), and XML (LINQ to XML).
-  Query expressions are written in a declarative query syntax. By using query syntax, you can perform filtering, ordering, and grouping operations on data sources with a minimum of code.
-  As a rule when you write LINQ queries, we recommend that you use query syntax whenever possible and method syntax whenever necessary. 
-  The variables in a query expression are all strongly typed.

**There are three parts to a query operation**

- Get the Data Source
- Create the Query
- Execute the Query.
